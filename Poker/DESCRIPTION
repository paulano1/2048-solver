A text-based video poker for Linux.

Many variants of video poker found in casinos are included as options.

The cards can be displayed as black or color characters, and also as Unicode
card faces.

It's a great way to practice your strategy for fun, or before going to a casino.
The text-based playing action allows for quick play and more rapid training than
with a GUI application.
