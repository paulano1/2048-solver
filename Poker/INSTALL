1. There is no 'configure' step.

2. To compile the program, run the command

make

   This requires that you have a version of
   gcc installed that supports the C99 standard.

3. To install, copy the executable file
   'videopoker' to a directory in your $PATH,
   such as /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, or /usr/games.

4. To run videopoker, simply run the command

videopoker

   in a virtual terminal. You will need to be
   using a font that supports Unicode card characters,
   such as the 'monospace' or 'DejaVu' fonts on
   Linux. If you do not have a font that supports
   Unicode card characters, run videopoker with
   the -u0 option, like this:

videopoker -u0
